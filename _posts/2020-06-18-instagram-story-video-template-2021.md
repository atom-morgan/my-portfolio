## The Problem...

You have a cool video. You decide it's worth its own Instagram story.

You open the app, select the video, and realize it's not suitable at all for IG stories.

Stories are portrait and your video was shot in landscape so it ends up looking like this. Far from ideal.

<img src="/images/ig-template/video.png" alt="Landscape video in Instagram story" style="display: block; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;"/>

## Story Templates

If you're smart and value your brand image, you want a nice template to wrap this video to give it a professional look. Thankfully, this isn't too difficult.

First, we need to know the dimensions for an Instagram story. As of 2021, it's 1080px (width) x 1920px (height).

Next, we need to know how much space to leave empty within this template for our video. After taking a few screenshots and taking another look in Photoshop, I came up with the following sections.

<img src="/images/ig-template/template-sections.png" alt="Instagram story template sections" style="display: block; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;"/>

This should be straightforward enough. In the middle grey section is a 1080px (width) x 600px (height) section for our video. The top and bottom sections are both 1080px (width) x 660px (height) which is where you get to be creative.

Here's what my finished template looks like with the middle section left as transparent for my videos.

<img src="/images/ig-template/template.png" alt="My Instagram story template" style="display: block; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;"/>

## How to Use Your Story Template

Now that your template is ready we can add it to our video.

First you'll need to create an IG story and select your video. You should see something like this.

<img src="/images/ig-template/step-1.png" alt="Add template to IG Story - Step 1" style="display: block; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;"/>

Next you'll need to switch to your Photos app, click the share icon, and select "Copy Photo".

Switch back to Instagram, tap the screen to open the text input, and click "Paste" to add your template.

<img src="/images/ig-template/step-2.png" alt="Add template to IG Story - Step 2" style="display: block; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;"/>

Once the image has been pasted, you should see your template above your video.

<img src="/images/ig-template/step-3.png" alt="Add template to IG Story - Step 3" style="display: block; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;"/>

Now you can simply touch the template image and pinch to scale it until your video fits nicely within the template.

## Conclusion

This is definitely a bit hacky but it does work. If you make your own IG templates, I'd love to see them. Feel free to [DM me on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/adamjmorgan/).
